"""GA5 Q11 — Observable Incident-Response Agent (q-agent-trace-integrity-server).

Multi-turn incident state machine driven by the grader through the receipts
endpoint. The grader is the tool transport: it observes every dispatch and posts
authoritative outcomes/approvals (with unpredictable nonces) that our final
result and OTLP trace must bind to.

Endpoints:
    POST /v2/incidents                     -> propose diagnosis + diagnostic dispatches
    POST /v2/incidents/{runId}/receipts    -> advance state on outcomes/approvals
    GET  /v2/incidents/{runId}             -> persisted state

Determinism / durability:
    * first-seen runId runs the (LLM or heuristic) decision once and persists it.
    * identical replay -> byte-identical JSON, no model rerun.
    * same runId (or receiptId) with changed content -> 409.
    * unsupported profile / malformed transition -> 400/422, create nothing.

Redaction: transcripts, prompts, sensitive values, tool arguments/results and
auth material NEVER leave the service in any span or persisted export.
